# 365 days of AI

Today, I attended an introductory session of the Developer's Student Club (DSC), where the guest speaker was Malik Muhammad Hassan, a former Project Manager at Folio3 and currently a Project Manager at Kyte Broking Ltd, London. The topic of the session was "Next-Gen Project Management Tools."

In this session, we got an overview of today’s leading project management tools and how AI is enhancing project tracking, forecasting, and task automation. I learned about essentials like Jira, Trello, and newer AI-integrated tools that help streamline team management. He also discussed how AI is game-changing in project management and highlighted ChatGPT as a valuable resource. He suggested using ChatGPT in our daily lives and projects. He also mentioned that when you need information related to a project or anything else, it’s a good idea to first gather the information from Google, and then use ChatGPT to refine and enhance your understanding. This approach can be incredibly helpful.
